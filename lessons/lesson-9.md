# Linting
A linter is a program which checks the syntax of your code. Some might be
smarter than others, but basically it complains when you break any set of
standards, for example, use 2 lines for tabs, align hashes properly, etc.

They are a very useful in development teams. There are several ways to run
linters, some do it on CI, but even if you do it in CI, it's great to have it in
your editor, so you get instant feedback.

Besides, it's good for writing consistent code. Even if you work alone, or it's
just a personal project, having a linter is totally worth it.

The only thing you have to use to enable linting in Vimo is installing the
proper linter. [You can see a list of all linters
here](https://github.com/w0rp/ale#supported-languages).
