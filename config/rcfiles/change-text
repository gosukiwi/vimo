" [ CHANGE TEXT ]
" When the "unnamed" string is included in the 'clipboard' option, the unnamed
" register is the same as the "* register.  Thus you can yank to and paste the
" selection without prepending "* to commands.
"
" X-11 systems use other registers, that's why we check for "unnamedplus"
let &clipboard = has('unnamedplus') ? 'unnamedplus' : 'unnamed'
