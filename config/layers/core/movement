":setting _'a_ is used to go to mark _a_, but it only remembers the line, not
" the column. This is not bad, but we can use _`a_ to go to the line as well as
" column where the mark was defined. Let's use this "better default" instead
" and swap _`_ with _'_.
"
" So _'a_ will go to the column as well as the line of the mark _a_.

":setting `0` will move to the beginning of a line. `^` will move to the
" beginning too, but it's smarter as it respect empty spaces. Because `0` is
" easier to reach, let's swap these.
