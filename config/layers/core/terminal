":setting:3 Aliases are diabled in non-interactive shells. So by default, Vim
"can't access your defined aliases. But using an interactive shell in Vim is
"troublesome. We can specify a custom shell file to be loaded here and enable
"aliases there as such:
"
"```
"#!/bin/bash
"shopt -s expand_aliases
"alias la='ls -la'
"```

"
" __NOTE__: If you are using `zsh`, then simply put the aliases in `~/.zshenv`
" instead.
